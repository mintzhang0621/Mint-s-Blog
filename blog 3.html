	<h1>Do People Like Dogs or Cats More?</h1>

		<li>Abstract</li>
		<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; According to common sense we might think that women will tend to like cats more than dogs. But is that true? To test out the credibility of this statement, we made a survey on our friends in our we-chat contact to test whether true. To collect our data, we sent a question that asks whether she likes cats or dogs to each woman in our we-chat contact. The result overturns the original hypothesis amazingly. We find out that the proportion of women who like cats is smaller than the proportion of women who like dogs. </p>
		<li>Problem Statement</li>
		<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; It is said that women like cats more than dogs, for cats are always cleaner and more sensitive than dogs, which shows that cats have similarities with some characteristics of female. We are curious about whether the statement is true. The purpose is either to prove that statement is correct or to overturn this statement. </p>
		<li>Background Research</li>
		<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; A lot of people believe that cats can better fascinate people compare to dogs, for cats are just like female that they’re clean. Some study shows that even some habits of cats are like female. However, no research has been done to prove this claim. (Female like cats better) <br>
		&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; A research about cats show that, compare to dogs, cats are more similar to female. For example, Cats have stronger self-awareness. They do not obey all the instruction of its owner (like dogs), which is just like female. Also, cats’ cleaner compare to dogs. Many people think cats’ elegant, and these adjective are also used to describe female. People are always fascinated by things that are similar to them, so cats attract female a lot.<br>
		&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Another research show that, because dogs also hunt with male and cats always stay at home with female in the ancient time, so it is obvious that female like cats better than dogs and prefer hold cats at home.</p>
		<li>The Study</li>
		<ol>
			<li>A.	Sampling or Experimental Design:</li>
			<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Our null hypothesis is that the proportion of female who like cats better is larger than the proportion of women who like dogs better. To collect the data, we made up a question as follow:</p><br>
			<ol><span style = "font-style: italic;">Do you like cats or dogs better? </span>
				<li>I like cats better than dogs.  </li>
				<li>I like dogs better than cats.  </li>
				<li>I like cats and dogs equally.  </li>
				<li>I like neither cats nor dogs. </li>
			</ol>
			<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Our population of interest is female. To obtain the data in an easiest way, we sent the question above to all female friends in our we-chat contact. After the data was fully collected, we summarized the results into 4 categories and collected the data.</p>
			<li>Data:</li>
			<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; The number of questions we sent is 188, and we only got 138 responses. Among those responses, only 80 responses are useable to us. It’s because those who give 3 or 4 as a response is not the type of people that have inclination to either cats or dogs. We did calculations on those 80 response. So our sample size is 80. In this sample, 31 people said that they like cats better.</p>
			<ul>Results: 
				<li>Number of people who chose 1 as a response: 31</li>
				<li>Number of people who chose 2 as a response: 49</li>
				<li>Number of people who chose 3 as a response: 49</li>
				<li>Number of people who chose 4 as a response: 9</li>
			</ul>
			<ul>Summarize: 
				<li>Women who receive question: 188</li>
				<li>Women who response our question: 138</li>
				<li>Number of effective responses(n): 80</li>
				<li>Women who said that they like cats more compare to dogs(np): 31</li>
			</ul>
			<li>Relevant Descriptive Statistics：</li>
			<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Our theoretical hypothesis looks similar to this Venn-Diagram. The bigger gibbous represents people who choose the first choice and the smaller one represents people who choose the second choice. We expected the bigger gibbous’ area is greater than the smaller gibbous. </p>

			<p>The data we collected is shown as a bar chat below. The lines colored in black are error bars to show the standard deviation. </p>
			<img class = "graph" alt = "graph2" src = "graph2.png">
			<p>The following pie chart is to show the proportions of people who chose four different answers. </p>
			<img class = "graph" alt = "formula" src = "graph3.png">
			<li>Significant Test</li>
			<ul>
				<li>Hypothesis:</li>
				<p>
				P = the proportion of female who will choose cat while comparing which they like more, dogs or cats<br>
				P = 0.5<br>
				P0 = 31/80 = 0.388<br>
				H0: P1 = (&gt;) 0.5 <br>
				Ha: P1 &lt; 0.5<br>
				</p>
			<li>Method:</li>
				<p>
				Q: Hypothesis testing<br>
				S: Sample data<br>
				T: Categorical, 1 variable<br>
				N: 1 sample<br>
				Base on the QSTN, we will use z-test to make the significance test<br>
				Check:<br>
				The sample is randomly selected and it’s representative. <br>
				nP0 = 31 &gt; 10<br>
				n(1 – P0) = 49 &gt; 10<br>
				</p>
			<li>Calculate：</li>
			<img src = "formula.png">
				<p>
				Confidence interval: 95%<br>
				α = 0.05<br>
				p-value = 0.022 &lt; 0.05<br>
				Communicate Results:<br>
				p-value &lt; α <br>
				∴Reject H0<br>
				</p>
			<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Based on the sample data, we are not convinced that the proportion of female who like cats more is greater compare to the proportion of female who like dogs more.</p>
			</ul>
		</ol>
	<li>Discussion</li>
	<ol>
		<li>We do not quite understand which category of the data we should use for the calculation of p-value. If we only ask people that they like cats or dogs, a large proportion of people will give unusable response such as “Both” and “Neither”. In order to prevent this condition, we should provide all choices.<br>
		&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Our sample data maybe is not randomly selected. It is because we asked females in our we-chat contact, and a large amount of female in our we-chat contact is our classmate (about the same age).</li>
		<li>We think we should have a research that has a total effective response of 300. As we can not account people who reject to answer our question, to ensure the sample data’s large enough we need a bigger sample distribution.</li>
		<li>Send the same question to males to figure out if male like dos better or not. </li>
		</ol>
		<li>Conclusion</li>
		<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; In order to prove or reject the claim about whether the claim that females like cats better than dogs is true, we designed a question and sent it to females in our we-chat contact. After we collected data, we did the significance test base on the result. We used the hypothesis testing method called z-test to calculate whether the p-value is smaller than 0.05. Because our p-value is 0.022, which is smaller than 0.05, the null hypothesis (Females like cats better than dogs) is rejected. </p>
